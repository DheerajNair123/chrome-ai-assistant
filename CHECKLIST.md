Chrome AI Assistant - On-Device Text Processing

This Chrome extension leverages Chrome's built-in AI models (Gemini Nano) to provide instant text processing capabilities directly in the browser, without sending data to external servers.

APIs Used:
- Prompt API: For general AI queries and term definitions
- Summarizer API: For condensing long text into key points
- Translator API: For language translation to English
- Rewriter API: For text simplification

Problem Solved:
Many users struggle with complex text, foreign languages, or lengthy articles while browsing. Traditional solutions require copying text to external websites or AI services, compromising privacy and interrupting workflow. This extension solves this by:

1. Privacy-First: All processing happens on-device using Chrome's built-in AI
2. Seamless Integration: Works on any webpage with simple text selection
3. Fast & Responsive: No network latency or API rate limits
4. Multiple Features: Summarize, define, translate, and simplify text instantly

The extension makes web browsing more accessible and efficient for everyone, from students to professionals, while maintaining complete user privacy.
```
